                  <p style="padding-top: 15px">
                    Adolescence can be a risky period for mental health problems
                    because teenagers are going through many changes and
                    challenges in a short period. Globally, one in seven 10-19
                    year olds experience a mental disorder, accounting for 13%
                    of the global burden of disease in this age group.
                    Depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders are among the
                    leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Good mental health is important for healthy teenage
                    development, strong relationships, and resilience. It can be
                    hard to identify signs of mental health disorders during
                    adolescence, especially as some diagnoses require
                    individuals to be 18 years old, but early intervention can
                    help teens learn healthier coping mechanisms. There are some
                    mobile apps like KIRAN app, available for adolescents with
                    mental issues which has already initiated a 24*7 Mental
                    health Rehabilitation Helpline for addressing the mental
                    health issues within the population. It is developed by the
                    Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities
                    (DEPwD) under the Ministry of Social Justice and
                    Empowerment, Govt. Of India because about 20% of young
                    people up to 18 years of age have a diagnosable mental
                    health problem in India.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other apps include calm, My3, MoodPath, and so on. Despite
                    these apps being available, the evidence for their
                    efficiency is unclear. It is necessary that an application
                    be formulated to improve the accessibility of these
                    services, especially for adolescents across the country. Not
                    only will this help in self-registration but also in
                    providing services to clients from the comfort of their home
                    even if they are not ready to talk about it.

                    and public spaces, maintaining workout routines became
                    difficult. In such a situation, staying fit and eating
                    healthy is important to build mental and physical well
                    being. People often tend to slack off or find it hard to
                    keep a routine as they simply lack motivation.

                    Development of a platform where one can not only see his/her
                    progress but also view friends' progress can build
                    motivation and can help in staying focused. This way one can
                    maintain a healthy lifestyle with friends while practising
                    social distancing and also motivate others to do the same.
                    The application allows users to make and edit their own
                    workout routine, based on a dataset (containing a variety of
                    exercises), using which it calculates the amount of calories
                    burnt. A diet recall is a dietary assessment tool that is
                    completed as a structured interview during which
                    participants are asked to recall the food and drinks they
                    have consumed over the last 24 hours. To accomplish this, it
                    relies on a trained interviewer to provide the correct
                    dataset and interviewing questions to be set up in the
                    mobile application, an accurate memory of intake, the
                    ability to estimate portion size, and the reliability of the
                    interviews to avoid false reports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a mobile application you can track the quality and
                    quantity of food taken (with pictures). An AI-based smart
                    food analyzer app that allows users to track their food
                    intake and also recommends a diet chart based on their vata,
                    kapha, and pitta constitutions. The application should
                    enable users to consult trainers and dietitians for advice
                    or personalized routines. To boost motivation it can also
                    allow users to be part of a community where they can share
                    experiences ,ask doubts and interact. The application can
                    include gamification features that will motivate the user to
                    follow their routines and diet charts(like badges, points,
                    etc.). An individual can compare their total calorie intake
                    and total calories burnt over a period of time (like a
                    day,week or month).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The general idea is to develop a mobile application or
                    software where it can perform various functions such as
                    allowing users to set fitness goals, tracking caloric
                    intake, gathering workout ideas,viewing one’s peers’
                    progress and sharing progress on social media to facilitate
                    healthy behavior change.The application can be used as a
                    platform to promote healthy behavior change with
                    personalized workouts, fitness advice and nutrition plans.

                  <h3>App to Report Drug Trafficking Anonymously</h3>

                  <p style="padding-top: 15px">
                    Due to its proximity to two of the "three key production
                    areas" for opium, India is facing an illegal drug crisis.
                    But cross-border trafficking explains only part of the
                    illicit drug trade that runs through the country. The
                    Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, states that India is
                    the world's largest generic drug manufacturer. However,
                    there are reports of illegal chemical precursor trades, as
                    well as clandestine manufacturing and storage of synthetic
                    drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consider the possibility of a drug peddler in your
                    neighbourhood. You see him supplying drugs to people,
                    including kids in your locality as well as other areas. At
                    present drug trafficking can only be reported via the
                    narcotics squad or local police station. There is no digital
                    means to report it. In spite of your desire to report it,
                    you're afraid of the potential mishaps that may occur if the
                    peddler finds out about the informant. This is not a viable
                    option since most of the public are not willing to reveal
                    their profiles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is proposed to develop a mobile application that would
                    allow the public to anonymously report drug trafficking.
                    Using this, people will be able to report such cases and the
                    number of drug trafficking cases will eventually come down
                    substantially. There is a chance that there may be many
                    false alarms if the system is anonymous, and some of them
                    may be intentional. Therefore by utilizing machine learning
                    models, the solution should be able to filter out the false
                    alarms. Ideally, users should be able to upload any relevant
                    information about the finding and it should be feasible for
                    them to use it across languages.
