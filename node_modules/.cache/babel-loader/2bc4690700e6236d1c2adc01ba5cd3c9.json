Depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.

Using a mobile application you can track the quality and quantity of food taken (with pictures). An AI-based smart food analyzer app that allows users to track their food intake and also recommends a diet chart based on their vat, pitta, and kapha constitutions.The application should enable users to consult trainers and dietitians for advice or personalized routines.To boost motivation it can also allow users to be part of a community where they can share experiences ,ask doubts and interact . The application can include gamification features that will motivate the user to follow their routines and diet charts(like badges, points, etc.).An individual can compare their total calorie intake and total calories burnt over a period of time (like a day,week or month).\n\nThe general idea  is to develop a mobile application or software where it  can perform various functions such as allowing users to set fitness goals, tracking caloric intake, gathering workout ideas,viewing one’s peers’ progress  and sharing progress on social media to facilitate healthy behavior change.The application can be used as a platform to promote healthy behavior change with personalized workouts, fitness advice and nutrition plans.\n`, `Due to its proximity to two of the \"three key production areas\" for opium, India is facing the illegal drugs crisis.

At present drug trafficking can only be reported via Narcotics squad or local police station.There is no digital means to report it.In spite of your desire to report it, you're afraid of the potential mishaps that may occur if the peddler finds out about the informant.Nonetheless, this is not a viable option since most of the public is not willing to reveal their profiles or spend time with each other.\n\nIt is proposed to develop a mobile application that would allow the public to anonymously report drug trafficking.Then, people will be able to report such cases, and the number of drug trafficking cases will eventually be reduced substantially. There is a chance that there may be many false alarms if the system is anonymous, and some of them may be intentional.Therefore by utilizing machine learning models, the solution should be able to filter out the false alarms.Ideally, users should be able to upload any relevant information about the finding and it should be feasible for them to use it across languages.\n`];\nexport default

The Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, states that India is the world's largest generic drug manufacturer.However, there are reports of illegal chemical precursor trades, as well as clandestine manufacturing and storage of synthetic drugs.\r\n\r\nConsider the possibility of a drug peddler in your neighbourhood.You see him supplying drugs to people,including kids in your locality as well as other areas. At present drug trafficking can only be reported via Narcotics squad or local police station.There is no digital means to report it.In spite of your desire to report it, you're afraid of the potential mishaps that may occur if the peddler finds out about the informant.Nonetheless, this is not a viable option since most of the public is not willing to reveal their profiles or spend time with each other.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to develop a mobile application that would allow the public to anonymously report drug trafficking.Then, people will be able to report such cases, and the number of drug trafficking cases will eventually be reduced substantially. There is a chance that there may be many false alarms if the system is anonymous, and some of them may be intentional.Therefore by utilizing machine learning models, the solution should be able to filter out the false alarms.Ideally, users should be able to upload any relevant information about the finding and it should be feasible for them to use it across languages.\r\n`];\r\n\r\nexport default function ProbModal(props) {\r\n    const [modalIsOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);\r\n    // const [IsGoingToRegister, setIsGoingToRegister] = React.useState(false);\r\n    // function toggleIsGoingToRegister() {\r\n    //     if (IsGoingToRegister) {\r\n    //         setIsGoingToRegister(false);\r\n    //         return document.getElementById('About').scrollIntoView();\r\n    //     }\r\n    // }\r\n    // function greenToggle() {\r\n    //     setIsOpen(false);\r\n    //     setIsGoingToRegister(true);\r\n    // }\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"App text-white mt-8\">\r\n            <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Read more</button>\r\n            <Modal\r\n                isOpen={modalIsOpen}\r\n                onRequestClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}\r\n                overlayClassName={{\r\n                    base: \"overlay-base\",\r\n                    afterOpen: \"overlay-after\",\r\n                    beforeClose: \"overlay-before\"\r\n                }}\r\n                className={{\r\n                    base: \"content-base\",\r\n                    afterOpen: \"content-after\",\r\n                    beforeClose: \"content-before\"\r\n                }}\r\n                // onAfterClose={toggleIsGoingToRegister}\r\n                closeTimeoutMS={500}\r\n            >\r\n                <div className=\"flex flex-col w-full mx-4 items-center justify-between h-full  text-white\">\r\n                    <div className=\"mt-4 w-full\">\r\n                        <div className=\"flex flex-row justify-between font-bold\">\r\n                            <span>{headings[props.id]}</span>\r\n                            <span className=\"\">\r\n                                <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)} className=\"bg-red-500 border-brochblack border-2 w-4 h-4 rounded-full mb-4\"></button>\r\n                            </span>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <hr></hr>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"flex justify-center items-start h-full my-4 overflow-y-scroll\">\r\n                        {contents[props.id]}\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"mb-4 w-full\">\r\n                        <hr></hr>\r\n                        <div className=\"flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-end\">\r\n\r\n                            <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)} className=\"border-2 w-fit bg-red-400 px-2 mt-4 border-brochblack text-brochblack font-bold rounded-sm\">Close</button>\r\n                            <a href={`${form_link}`} target=\"_blank\">\r\n                                <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)} className=\"border-2 ml-4 w-fit bg-green-600 border-gray-700 text-gray-700 font-bold px-2 mt-4 rounded-sm\">Register  </button>\r\n                            </a>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </Modal>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
